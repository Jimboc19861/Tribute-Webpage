                    On February 17th 1963, Michael Jeffrey Jordan was born in Brooklyn, New York and little did
                    anyone know at the time but the game of basketball would never be the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He played fifteen seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA), winning six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls.
                    Jordan is the principal owner and chairman of the Charlotte Hornets of the NBA and of 23XI Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Michael Jordan is widley considered certainly as one of but, by a lot of fans and peers, the greatest basketball player
                    of all time and in a list of the 75 greatest players for the NBA's 75th anniversary, he was listed as number one.

                <p>Michael Jeffrey Jordan was raised as the son of bank employee Deloris and equipment supervisor James R Jordan Snr in Brooklyn.</p>
                <p>At the age of five, Michael and his family moved to Wilmington, North Carolina where he would remain until his draft
                some twenty years later.</p>

                    The Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA draft after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers).
                    One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jordan made his NBA debut at Chicago Stadium on October 26, 1984, and scored 16 points. In 2021, a ticket stub from the game sold at auction for $264,000, setting a record for a collectible ticket stub. 
                    During his rookie 1984–85 season with the Bulls, Jordan averaged 28.2 ppg on 51.5% shooting, and helped make a team that had won 35% of games in the previous three seasons playoff contenders. 
                    He quickly became a fan favorite even in opposing arenas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fans also voted in Jordan as an All-Star starter during his rookie season. Controversy arose before the 1985 NBA All-Star Game when word surfaced that several veteran players, led by Isiah Thomas, were upset by the amount of attention Jordan was receiving.
                    This led to a so-called "freeze-out" on Jordan, where players refused to pass the ball to him throughout the game. 
                    The controversy left Jordan relatively unaffected when he returned to regular season play, and he would go on to be voted the NBA Rookie of the Year. 
                    The Bulls finished the season 38–44,and lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in four games in the first round of the playoffs.
